.TH PCAPFIX 1 "22 JAN 2019"

.SH "NAME"
pcapfix \- repair pcap and pcapng files

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpcapfix\fP [\-d] [\-n] [\-o filename] [\-t DATA_LINK_TYPE] [\-v] filename

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pcapfix is a tool to repair your damaged or corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It is written in C and released under the GNU General Public License.

To fix your pcap files the tool first checks for an intact pcap global header and repairs it if there are some corrupted bytes. It there seems to be no global header at all, pcapfix adds a self-created one at the beginning of the file. In a second step the tool tries to find pcap packet headers inside the file, below the global header. It checks if the values are correct (or seem to be correct) and tries to repair a packet if there is something wrong.

To fix your pcapng files the tool loops through all packet headers that can be found in the file. It checks for mandatory Section Header and Interface Description Block and creates them if missing. Pcapfix checks for correct block sizes and valid option fields. If something is wrong, invalid fields are repaired (if possible) or skipped and adjusted to finally get a proper pcapng file.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 5
\-d, \-\-deep\-scan
Force deep scan (default = 0)
.br
\-s, \-\-soft\-mode
Switch to soft mode packet detection (default = 0)
.br
This option will force pcapfix to scan for any packet inside the whole file (instead of the first 262144 (max snaplen) bytes only).
.TP
\-n, \-\-pcapng
Force File Format to PCAPNG (default = 0)
.br
This option will force pcapfix to repair the input file as it were in pcapng format (useful for destroyed file headers).
.TP
\-o, \-\-outfile <filename>
Set the output file name. Default will be input file prepended by "fixed_".
.TP
\-t, \-\-data\-link\-type <nr>
Data Link Type (default = 1)
.br
(See NOTES section below.)
.TP
\-v, \-\-verbose
Enable verbose output (default = 0)
.br
You can use multiple \-v options to increase verbosity.
.br
An verbosity of 2 will result in very much output data during package search.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP 5
Repair the pcap file using deep scan mode, because large blocks of the file are corrupted.
pcapfix \-d file.pcap
.TP
Repair the file damaged_file.pcapng using verbose output.
pcapfix \-v damaged_file.pcapng
.TP
Repair the file wlan_traffic.pcap and force the data link type to be 119 (PRISM HEADER).
pcapfix \-t 119 wlan_traffic.pcap
.TP
Repair the file damaged.pcapng which file header is corrupted and force its format to be pcapng.
pcapfix \-n damaged.pcapng

.SH "NOTES"
.TP 5
\fIOutput file name\fP

If you want to perform the reparation process on the input file without creating a separate output file - e.g. in case you are out of space, you can use the -o option and give the same name as the input file.

WARNING: This process is DANGEROUS and may destroy your data. You should only use this option if you know what you are doing and accept the risk of losing the input file.

.TP
\fIDeep scan\fP

In classic pcap files, pcapfix will only scan the first 65536 bytes (maximum packet length) for a proper first packet. If you want to force packet detection even above this limit (e.g. because your file has been heavily destroyed) you can use the deep scan option (\-d).

This option is not necessary for pcapng files because the whole file is arranged in blocks that are 'unlimited' by default. In result pcapfix will always scan the whole pcapng file for further blocks.

.TP
\fISoft mode\fP

There are programs that breach some pcap conventions when writing files. Ignoring those rules do not break the pcap file but they make it difficult for pcapfix to identify the packets in case of broken files.

By default pcapfix uses hard mode. If you encounter problems when repairing files, try to switch to soft mode (-s). Pcapfix will then try to find the packets in a more tolerant way.

.TP
\fIPCAPNG Format\fP

Pcapfix will try to identify the file format to repair (pcap / pcapng) before doing any further checks. If the header itself is corrupted, it will assume the format to be classic pcap. To change this behaviour you can force the tool to do a pcapng-repair by supplying \-n (\-\-pcapng) option.

.TP
\fIVerbosity\fP

You can use multiple \-v options to increase verbosity. An verbosity of 2 will result in very much output data during package search.

.TP
\fIASCII-mode transferred Files (FTP)\fP

Pcapfix is able to repair pcap files that have been transferred in ascii-mode via FTP. In those files a proper pcap structure will be created only to make them readable by wireshark etc. The data inside the packets (and some pcap headers) might still be corrupted. To repair those packets a deeper look inside the packet structure (e.g. checksum) will be necessary.

.TP
\fIData Link Types\fP

You can make pcapfix change / select your data link type by supplying \-t option. Although you may select a data link type number between 0 and 255, only the following types are assigned: If the data link type field is corrupt, pcapfix will select LINKTYPE_ETHERNET by default.
